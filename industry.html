<h3>David Spivak from Topos Institute

<h3>Alan Hylton from NASA: <p>
Towards a theory for the solar system internet
</h3>
Sustainability of accelerating space presence will depend on increasing the scalability of communications capability; in a word, networking. The so-called Solar System Internet represents a vast generalization of the Internet as we know it, and to prevent any plateauing of the technology we need a suitable theory. Efforts to model the time-varying, mobile, heterogeneous system of space systems has led to a natural application of mathematics from algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and beyond. In this talk we will focus on how space communications motivated us to consider sheaf-theoretic constructions with a nod to other active areas of research to explain our progress.
<h3>  Spencer Breiner from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): <p>  You say you are from NIST?</h3>

<h3> Brandon Baylor from Chevron: <p>A Compositional approach to complex systems</h3>

<h3>Brandon Baylor and Esteban Monterro from Holon Computing Labs:<p>
Engineering a collective computer</h3>

<h3> Bob Coecke from Quantinuum: <p>
ZX-calculus at Quantinuum and in quantum industry</h3>
 We give an overview of the recent developments and many uses of ZX-calculus in quantum industry, spanning compilation, education, publication, error-correction, and in particular the use in photonic quantum computing, which, in fact, is the origin of ZX-calculus.
<h3>  Ryan Wisnesky from Conexus:<p> 
Conexus AI: an overview</h3>
In this talk we describe the past, present, and future of Conexus AI, summarizing how we understand databases as co-presheaves and giving an overview of the kind of data-integration-related category theory we perform for clients.

<h3>Stanislav Kapulkin from Viete</h3> 
Closed cartesian (monoidal) categories could be represented in a 2-d plane in a form of string diagrams or dual to them commutative diagrams. Viete will demonstrate an interactive editor for closed Cartesian categories with support for nested (hierarchical) diagrams and automatic arrangement of elements based on the structure of the diagrams. Several solutions, such as linking mechanism, imports, folding, and others, allow working with large projects within the editor. This paves the way for using diagrams inside the editor as an industrial programming language.
<h3> Philipp Zahn from 20 Squares: <p>
Compositional economic modeling</h3> 
At 20squares we do composable economic modelling. We rely on our own software framework that is based on compositional game theory. In this presentation we will discuss the role of compositionality in our approach and what it takes to bring abstract nonsense to the market.
